# Project - Dask

The evaluation for this class is a [Dask notebook](https://github.com/SupaeroDataScience/DE/blob/master/notebooks/EvaluationDaskMLTaxyCabEmpty.ipynb). You should run this notebook on a Daskhub using Kubernetes, like in the [Dask on Kubernetes class](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/DE/2_5_dask.html). You should complete the exercises and answer the questions in the notebook, then turn it in through the [LMS](https://lms.isae.fr/mod/assign/view.php?id=103701). You may work with a partner, in this case make sure to specify in your notebook that you worked together.

The notebook is due on March 17, 2023 by midnight.
