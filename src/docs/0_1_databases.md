# Data Storage

In this module on databases, database management systems will be covered. A basic understanding of SQL is considered as a prerequisite, and students can refer to the slides and additional resources if needed. For evaluation, students will install and explore the advantages of different DBMSs as a graded project.

In this first class, we introduce the basics of database management systems and cover high level DBMS functionality.

For the [next class](0_2_postgres.md), students should install PostgreSQL and MongoDB on their local machines.
