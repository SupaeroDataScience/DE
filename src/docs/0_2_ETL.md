# Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)

In this module on ETL, we will cover the fundamental concepts and practices of data integration and processing. A basic understanding of databases and SQL is considered a prerequisite. Students can refer to the slides and additional resources if they need to refresh their knowledge. For evaluation, students will design and implement an ETL pipeline as a graded [project](0_4_project.md).

In this first class, we introduce the basics of ETL processes and cover high-level ETL functionality and tools.
