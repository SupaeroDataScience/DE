# Project - Dask

The evaluation for this class is a [Dask notebook](https://github.com/SupaeroDataScience/DE/blob/master/notebooks/EvaluationDaskMLTaxyCabEmpty.ipynb). You should run this notebook on a Daskhub using Kubernetes, like in the [Dask on Kubernetes class](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/DE/2_5_dask.html). You should complete the exercises and answer the questions in the notebook, then turn it in through the [LMS](https://lms.isae.fr/mod/assign/view.php?id=113869). You should work in a group of 2 to 4 and separate the work out equally between responding to questions, managing the infrastructure, and trying out different algorithms. **Be sure to include the names of your group members in your submission.**

The notebook is due on March 12, 2024 at 23h59.
