# NoSQL Databases Project

![NoSQL databases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SupaeroDataScience/DE/master/src/reveal/static/img/NoSQL-Database-Types.jpg)

The evaluation of the databases class is a presentation of a specific DBMS. You can work in teams of 4 of your choosing.

The idea of this project is to study new DBMSs, with a focus on NoSQL DBMSs. There is a [presentation](https://lms.isae.fr/mod/resource/view.php?id=36332) on the differences between relational databases and various NoSQL DBMSs and another [here](https://lms.isae.fr/mod/resource/view.php?id=81798) on the history of NoSQL. In this project, students should compare their DBMS with a relational DBMS (PostgreSQL) to understand the advantages and disadvantages of various NoSQL DBMSs.

You are working in a company which is looking to replace a relational DBMS currently in use. Each team should present a feasability study of a specific DBMS, showing its advantages, disadvantages, and use cases. We will organize the subjects on 06/10/2021, which is a work class dedicated to the project. Up to two different teams can work on each DBMS.

The possible DBMSs are:

1. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/), a DBMS for documents used, for example, by CERN
2. [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/), a distributed data storage system for handling very large amounts of structured data
3. [Redis](http://redis.io/), a very efficient key/value DBMS
4. [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/), a distributed and non-relationed column-based DBMS
5. [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/), a native graph DBMS
6. [RavenDB](https://ravendb.net/), a document DBMS with ACID integrity
7. [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/), a document DBMS for interactive web applications
8. [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/), a JSON-based DBMS with native JavaScript support
9. [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/get-influxdb/), a distributed DBMS optimized for timeseries data
10. [OrientDB](https://orientdb.org/), a DMBS for graph data

Each team should:

+ install their DBMS
+ test the DBMS on a relevant database (datasets from [Google](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), and [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets))
+ compare their DBMS with a relational database system
+ prepare a presentation of their DBMS and example database which presents convincing argument for using this DBMS
+ evaluate how ACID or BASE principles are met by their DBMS

A good example from previous years is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SupaeroDataScience/DE/master/readings/mongodb.pdf). This was in the form of a report, but currently a report is not required, just the oral presentation.

Presentations will take place on 02/11/2021. You should upload your presentation materials to the LMS before midnight on 01/11/2021.
